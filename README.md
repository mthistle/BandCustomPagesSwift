# THIS IS An OLD SAMPLE FOR Swift 1.2 and Xcode 6.3 Beta - You can use this as a reference but the code is out of date. For Swift 2 samples, see: https://github.com/mthistle/MicrosoftBandKit_iOS-Swift2/

# BandCustomPagesSwift
Swift version of the Microsoft Band Kit sample app BandCustomPages. This sample will create a tile on the Band with a custom page that includes a Barcode. To remove the tile use the [Microsoft Health App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-health/id912580285?mt=8), available in the AppStore.

This is a port of the BandCustomPages example from the Microsoft Band Kit SDK for iOS samples. The SDK can be found at http://developer.microsoftband.com/
